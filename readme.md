This game is inspired by Kevin Yi's whack a mole game with a halloween twist!
As of right now, the objective of the game is to click the bear 
while also trying to avoid the purple guy. Eveyertime you hit the bear you would get 
10 points and if you are fast enough, multiple clicks earn bonus points.
Be careful though, you may be in for a scare if you accidently hit the purple guy!
The game uses code that creates the tiles into the html and inserts images that are clickable.
When you click a tile, it runs it through an if statement where if the tile id that you clicked matches
the tile id that has a bear or man, it will respond accordingly. If a purple guy is hit, it pops up a mp4 file that
autoplays when activated. If you would like to play the game again, a button appears to set the game up again.

Enjoy!
